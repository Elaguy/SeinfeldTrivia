------------------------
- Bugginess Level: High

- Implemented data-gathering system
- Implemented QuestionGui basics
- Implemented Correct Answer system for QuestionGui
- Implemented one-line, on their own line, comments for data.txt file 
- Implemented proper button functionality (when correct answer or wrong
answer buttons are clicked, they show their respective colors and all the
other buttons are disabled)
- Implemented a (by default) 5 second timer that gives the user time
to see if they got the question right or wrong before moving on to the
next question, program moves on to next question automatically
- Made data gathering and the triviaData ArrayList transfer from Data
to QuestionGui more efficient (Data no longer repeatedly goes through
the data.txt file after doing it once)

VERSION: 0.5a - 11/12/16
------------------------
- ALPHA!

- Bugginess Level: Medium

- Cleaned up the infamous QuestionGui actionPerformed method
- Implemented two buggy timers (the answer timer and the move on delay timer)
- Fixed a timer bug
- All timers work! (mostly)
- The timer will stop and not display 'out of time!' or anything else when
user pressed the correct answer right when time is 0
- Implemented a thread that continuously checks if user has pressed the 'start trivia'
button (which is synonymous with arriving at the QuestionGui JPanel/'screen'. If so, the
answer timer is started. This prevents the timer running and running out of time before
the user ever enters the QuestionGui JPanel

will be the focus of the Beta phase. Major Aesthetic work will probably not be
implemented, ever.
