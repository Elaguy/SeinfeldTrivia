1. Program goes to QuestionGui

2. Data will go thru txt file containing:
   - Question
   - 4 Answers
   - File address to picture
   And will place this info in an ArrayList
   and send it to QuestionGui
   
3. QuestionGui will look at ArrayList and initialize
the JPanel based on these rules:

   A question, an array of 4 questions, and a
   file address to pic makes up a 6 index "block"

   ArrayList model:
   0 1 2 3 4 5  6 7 8 9 10 11  12 13 14 15 16 17

   - Every 6 indexes are a QUESTION STRING (including the
   first index - 0)
   - The 4 indexes after the first one are the 4
   ANSWER STRINGS
   - The last index after the 4 answers are a FILE ADDRESS
   TO AN IMAGE 
   
4. Once the JPanel is initalized, a 10 second timer starts

5. Once the user answers correctly or runs out of time, the JPanel
calls itself again and again (each time deleting the previous 3 index 
"block" from the ArrayList), repeating for as many questions there are
until it hits a default 10 question limit (which can be modified)
 or until it runs out of data from the ArrayList

6. The program gathers the score info

7. The program changes to a score JPanel and shows the user their
score (how many questions they got right, how many they got wrong,
and then a corrosponding medal).

8. The user can quit, go back to the main menu, or start a new trivia round
